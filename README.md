# AlphaGo_Gomoku
This is a small version of AlphaGo Zero written with Keras.
It can play Gomoku like human.
Keras version:2.1.5  



## Model in Detial
### CNN block



input: raw boards * 4

       1st 1 if current_move else 0
       2nd 1 if opposite_move else 0
       3rd 1 if last_move else 0
       4th all 1 if current_player is on the offensive
       
       
output: list p for every available position
        value v for confidence of winning
        
structure:  3*convs + {conv+flatten+dense, conv+flatten+dense+dense}



### MCTS block
A Mento Calo Tree is combined by MCT Nodes
#### MCT Node
A BiDirect Tree Node that contains:
Parent
Children
perior probability p
action value Q(s,a)
UCT alogrithm U

It can:

select  choose move by Q + U greedy

expand  expand a leaf node by actions and probabilities

update  N and Q

With the help of MCT Node, a MCTS can:

play_a_step   choose a move greedy until leaf node, expand chilren by CNN blocks

simulate      simulate and update MCT in N times, return all actions and probabilities

move          move with highest probability

### Training 
We collect self play data with dirac noise and shift with randomly rotate.

Train CNN with best policy Pi  and winning rate v generated by MCTS

Adjust learning rate by D_KL adaptively

Evaluate performance of current model against a Pure MCTS(simulation steps further when current model perform better)
